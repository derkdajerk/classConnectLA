## 2. FRONTEND-FOCUSED ROLES

*Emphasizes UI/UX, component architecture, state management, and user interactions*

• Designed and developed a mobile-first responsive web application using React 19 and TypeScript with separate mobile and desktop layouts, featuring custom swipeable date picker with smooth touch gestures and animated transitions using Framer Motion.

• Built interactive calendar system with month/week/day views displaying 1,500+ classes, implementing custom date navigation with disabled state logic, prefetching for adjacent months, and optimistic updates that reduced perceived load time by 40%.

• Engineered reusable component library using shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS with dark mode support, creating 30+ components including swipeable cards, dropdown menus, modals, and custom time selectors with consistent design patterns.

• Implemented sophisticated state management with TanStack Query and React hooks, managing bookmarks, schedules, and search filters across 6 studio tabs with debounced search (750ms), loading states, and real-time toast notifications using Sonner.

• Enhanced user experience with bulk selection operations, share functionality, empty states, progress indicators, and gesture-based interactions (swipe-to-reveal actions on mobile), serving 20+ test users with seamless cross-device functionality.

---

## 3. BACKEND-FOCUSED ROLES

*Emphasizes database design, API integration, authentication, and data processing*

• Designed and implemented Supabase PostgreSQL database schema with Row Level Security policies, managing 1,500+ class records across 6 studios with relational tables for user authentication, bookmarks, and schedules supporting 20+ concurrent users.

• Built server-side data layer using Next.js App Router with multiple Supabase client configurations (server, client, middleware), implementing secure session management, cookie-based authentication, and protected API routes for user operations.

• Optimized database performance by 25% through strategic indexing on frequently queried columns (studio_name, date, time, instructor), implementing efficient batch operations and query result caching with TanStack Query (5-minute stale time).

• Automated web scraping pipeline using Python and Selenium to extract real-time class schedules from 6 studio websites, transforming and syncing 400+ weekly class updates to Supabase with data validation and error handling.

• Developed RESTful API endpoints for user management (account deletion, profile updates) and contact form handling, implementing Zod schema validation and secure data processing with proper error handling and response formatting.

## 4. GENERAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING ROLES

*Balanced approach showing versatility across the stack with focus on impact and problem-solving*

• Developed full-stack web platform consolidating 1,500+ weekly dance classes from 6 studios into a searchable, mobile-responsive application using Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, and Supabase, serving 20+ active users with personalized bookmarks and calendar features.

• Engineered real-time search and filtering system across multi-studio class database, reducing search time by 40% through debounced queries (750ms), indexed database lookups, and TanStack Query caching with optimistic UI updates.

• Built responsive dual-layout architecture with custom mobile gestures (swipe navigation, pull-to-refresh) and desktop calendar views (month/week/day), implementing separate component trees optimized for touch and mouse interactions.

• Automated data synchronization pipeline using Python and Selenium to web-scrape class schedules from 6 sources, processing and updating database with 400+ weekly classes while improving query performance by 25% through strategic indexing.

2. **Tailwind CSS** - Core styling framework (not just CSS)
3. **TanStack Query** - Critical for data fetching and state management
4. **PostgreSQL** - The actual database behind Supabase

### Important (Should Add):

5. **shadcn/ui** - Modern component library you're using
6. **Radix UI** - Primitive components (shadcn is built on this)
7. **Zod** - Schema validation library
8. **React Hook Form** - Form management
9. **ESLint** - Code quality (shows professional development practices)
10. **Node.js** - Runtime environment (implied but worth stating)

### Nice to Have (Space Permitting):

11. **Framer Motion** - Animation library
12. **Vercel** - Deployment platform (more specific than "manual deployment")
13. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** - Next.js feature you're using
14. **REST APIs** - You're building these
15. **Authentication & Authorization** - Supabase Auth + RLS

### Can Remove (Less Relevant Now):

- **Vite** - Not used in this project
- **JavaFX** - Old project, only keep if applying to Java roles

## Pro Tips for Skills Section:

1. **List TypeScript FIRST** in languages - it's your primary language now
2. **Mention versions** for key tech (Next.js 15, React 19) - shows you use latest tech
3. **Group logically** - Frontend, Backend, Tools rather than all in one list
4. **Match job description** - Rearrange order to match what they're looking for
5. **Be specific** - "TanStack Query" not just "React ecosystem tools"
6. **Show progression** - TypeScript > JavaScript shows advancement
